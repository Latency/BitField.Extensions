A simple use of bit fields as flags. Bit fields allow packaging of data into simple structures, and they are particularly useful when bandwidth, memory or data storage is at a premium. This might not appear to be an issue with modern day equipment or every day applications, but we can save up to 16 times more memory and storage when using bit fields instead of other value types such as Boolean.
